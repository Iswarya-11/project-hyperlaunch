What I have done in this project?
  → In this project, I have worked on a real-world dataset to predict Salary of employees using Machine Learning techniques.

 Feature & Target Column:
→ Features (Independent Variables) :
  Job ID
  Experience
  Job Title
  Company Type
  Location
  Remote Ratio

→ Target (Dependent Variable) :
  Salary in USD (This is what I am trying to predict)

Why I used these Features?
  These are the main factors that actually impact the salary of a person in real-life.
  Each feature gives an important insight about a person's working condition, skill, company & role.

Visualization?
  Visualization helps to understand the pattern, relationship & trend between data.
  I have used different types of graphs like:
   Count Plot
   Pie Chart
   Bar Graph
   Scatter Plot
   Heatmap (for correlation)

→ To make the dataset more visually attractive & easy to understand.

Why I used Linear Regression?
   Linear Regression is the best algorithm when there is a numeric value to predict (like Salary).
   It finds the relationship between features & target value and gives a prediction model.
   Easy to interpret & most suitable for this dataset.
   
Final Conclusion:
   > "Thus, by using Machine Learning, Visualization, and Linear Regression Model, this project successfully analyzes employee data and predicts the salary based on various
factors. This project not only helps in salary prediction but also highlights how data-driven decisions can shape the future of industries."
